# Analysis of U.S. federal income taxes. 2020
----
Like most of my projects, this one started because I found all the information I came across lacking. Taxes are practically complicated by design and this has spawned many industries and services that try to make it easy for consumers. This project is my attempt at making the topic easier to digest. My hope is that this can help some one put into perspective the relative proportions of their earned income that go into paying state and federal taxes. 

Here are some images to wet your appetite. For full notebook and interactibility please see the `tax_calculations.ipynb` located at the root of this directory.
