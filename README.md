# Analysis of U.S. federal income taxes. 2020
----
Like most projects, this started because I was unable to find good visual representations of what I was looking for. The analysis so far is relatively basic and I plan to sate tax graphs and some tax deduction calculations when owning property.

Please let me know if you spot any errors or have any commens.
